Revenue Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression


Problem Statement

An ice cream business will like to predict the daily revenue generated in dollars based on the outside air temperature(degC). In this project, I applied Linear Regression model to solve the task.
Dataset is obtained from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/ahmednour/ice-cream-dataset
In the dataset, there are two fields -
- Independent variable X: Outside Air Temperature in degree Celsius and
- Dependent variable Y: Overall daily revenue generated in dollars.
